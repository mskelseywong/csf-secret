    <p>
      There are at least twenty-nine types of native ducks seen in North America. 
      Not included among these waterfowl are the eiders, loons, mergansers and grebes, which make up another fourteen species of waterfowl. 
      Then, there are the swans and geese, which is another eight species of larger members of the waterfowl group.

    <!-- below are more details on duck types -->
    <!-- this contains the first secret, which is "flight" -->
    <p>
      Among these different types, the birds can be grouped again into puddle, aka "dabbling" and diving ducks. 
      The dabblers mostly feed in smaller bodies of shallow water or along shorelines, where they are able to tip their bodies forward to 
      reach their food on the floors of the bodies of water. Then, there are divers, who feed in deeper water where they dive and pursue 
      their quarry. The Harlequin Duck, for example, actually dives to the bottom of fast-flowing waters and feeds on life forms attached to rocks.
